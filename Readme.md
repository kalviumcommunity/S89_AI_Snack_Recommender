    Project Title: Mood-To-Food: AI Snack Recommender
    Project Overview:
    Mood-To-Food is a fun web app that analyzes a user's mood (through facial recognition, emoji selection, or text input) and recommends the perfect snack to match. The goal is to create a lighthearted, interactive experience that combines AI, user input, and a bit of randomness to deliver entertaining food suggestions.

    * Key Features:
    * Mood Detection: Uses facial recognition, emoji selection, or text input to determine the userâ€™s mood.
    * Snack Recommendation: Suggests a food item based on the detected mood.
    * Random Silly Mode: Generates completely random and unexpected food pairings.
    * Personalized Snack History: Keeps track of past moods and snacks recommended.
    * Sharing Feature: Allows users to share their snack recommendations with friends.
    Tech Stack:
    Frontend: React.js (for UI), Tailwind CSS (for styling)
    Backend: Node.js with Express (for handling API requests)
    Database: MongoDB (for storing user preferences & history)
    AI/Machine Learning: TensorFlow.js or Face-api.js (for facial recognition)
    Authentication: Firebase or Auth0 (if user login is needed)
    Why This Project?
    This project is both fun and technically challenging, making it a great learning opportunity. It involves AI/ML integration, frontend/backend development, and user experience design. It also allows for creativity with food pairings and humor, making it engaging and unique.
